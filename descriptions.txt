Most scripts require root file saved in sibling directory called "data"
Will save all created data in this sibling directory
Root file used for testing: user.bochen.25650990.OUTPUT._000001.root

For root file to .coe files:
  - root_to_coe.py
      * can specify layers, bit length, ranges and granularities of slices
      * loops through events, creating file for each in which .coe files are made for each layer
      * .coe files will have header with info and grid of lines and columns of ET values

To visualize .coe files:
  - visualize_coe.py
     * specify folder of run, layer, and event
     * shows visualization of .coe file, whitespace is 0 energy detected
     
To compare .coe to .root:
  - filtered_hist.py
     * specify layer and number of events
     * has function makeHist() that saves numpy array to 'npfile.npz' in data directory
     * if called as main, also plots histogram
     
  - hist_coe.py
     * specify layer, number of events, run folder
     * calls makeHist() from filtered_hist, can edit parameters in script
     * loops over and plots data from .coe files layered with comparison from filtered_hist
     * can comment out lines to get rid of comparison graph
     
To visualize original data:
  - filtered_hist.py (see above)
  - unfiltered_hist.py (plots raw ET values from root file, no layers or slices)
  - one_layer_hist.py (plots one layer of data for all or some events, no slices)
  - one_event_hist.py (plots all data for one event, no layers or slices)

To manipulate original data from terminal:
  - open_file.py
     * best when called as >>> python -i open_file.py
     * returns variable "data" which stores arrays of data, good for sampling/debugging
